I have created a Food Ordering app via SMS
To use this app you have to download the code and unzip it and then with the help of VSCode you can run the code
To run:

The first time run npm install
Press ctrl-f5 while your focus is in one of the files that starts with a number and is all lower case.
You can Order the Food by sending a message and there will be a prompt with saying Welcome
In the next step you'll recieve some options of Food You'd like
At the end you'll recieve the total Order placed and The total amount of Order with taxes and the Delivery Details will be displayed
Thank you


The Reasons why I took the Apache License 2.0 is

Regardless of whether they have modified it or not, anyone who uses open source software covered by the Apache 2.0 licence must include the following in their copy of the code:

The first copyright warning

a duplicate of the actual licence

An explanation of any important changes made to the original code, if appropriate

a duplicate of the NOTICE file containing credit information (if the original library has one)

A key distinction between the Apache License 2.0 and other permissive licences is the third stipulation mentioned above. Any significant changes you make to the licenced code must be disclosed in any upgraded versions you distribute.

You are not required to distribute the updated code under Apache 2.0, though. Any modification notifications must be included in order to comply with the licence terms.
